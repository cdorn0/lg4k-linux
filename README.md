# Live Gamer 4K Linux driver

Based on the Linux driver for the [CL511HN](https://www.avermedia.com/professional/product/cl511hn/overview)
which can be downloaded here: [Generic_Ubuntu_CL511HN_Drv_1.0.0031.zip](http://storage.avermedia.com/web_release_www/CL511HN/Generic_Ubuntu_CL511HN_Drv_1.0.0031.zip)

The CL511HN and GC573 (Live Gamer 4K) are very similar and their drivers are *mostly* interchangable. Though the firmware differences mean that some modes won't work on the LG4K.

This was tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Fedora 32. Linux distributions other than Ubuntu (such as Fedora) might require the patches found on the `fedora` branch.

**Caveats:**
* Driver needs to be recompiled/installed manually every time there's a kernel update
* RGB LEDs are not supported and will keep flashing red
* Scaler doesn't seem to work so selected resolution has to match input resolution

## How to

* clone git repository
* run `./build.sh`
  + Note: switch to `fedora` branch if it doesn't compile and try again
* run `sudo ./install.sh`
* run `sudo modprobe gc573` or reboot

## ToDo

* ~~Make driver load automatically~~
* Maybe see if we can send a signal to turn off the LEDs by looking at the Windows driver
* Check some audio issues in OBS and see why RGB24 doesn't work in there either
